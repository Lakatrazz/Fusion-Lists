# Fusion Lists
Remotely fetched lists for the [Fusion multiplayer mod](https://github.com/Lakatrazz/BONELAB-Fusion).

## Global Ban List
The Global Ban List is located at [globalBans.json](globalBans.json). It contains the following information in json format:
- Username
- Reason
- Games
    - Application Name
- Platforms
    - Platform ID
    - Platform Name
 
Global bans prevent the joining and hosting of Public and Private lobbies, but still allow Friends Only lobbies. Bans are reserved for only the most problematic users; smaller offenses can be handled by individual lobby bans.

For someone to be globally banned, verifiable hard evidence needs to be provided by multiple sources. One source will not constitute a ban.

If you would like to report someone, [submit a ban report here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGK73O2jhOQOXtfHFahOrMZeuVfjYlKbdDPupaifjLGG_QMA/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=101387100992631090035)

If you are banned and would like to appeal, [submit an appeal here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqgBtc-EOxNvrtQIPJaC4W1xsrhVqe6DbxuSpvwicQBg_JMQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=101387100992631090035)

You can view the general Fusion rules [here](RULES.md).

## Profanity List
The Profanity List is located at [profanityList.json](profanityList.json) and contains excessive slurs and curse words that are blocked from lobby names, descriptions, usernames, etc.

Profanity can be toggled on or off in Fusion settings.

## Global Mod Blacklist
The Global Mod Blacklist is located at [globalModBlacklist.json](globalModBlacklist.json) and contains mod.io mods with malicious spawnables, avatars, or other features.

Similar to the Global Ban List, globally blacklisted mods are only for severe cases.

Prohibited:
- Contains hidden, malicious content that allows the user to crash or grief public lobbies

Allowed:
- Everything else (including NSFW avatars, as long as they are marked mature)

Globally blacklisted mods will still function in Private and Friends Only lobbies, but they will not function in Public lobbies.
