# Fusion Lists
Remotely fetched lists for the [Fusion multiplayer mod](https://github.com/Lakatrazz/BONELAB-Fusion).

## Global Ban List
The Global Ban List is contained at [globalBans.json](globalBans.json). It contains the following information in json format:
- Username
- Reason
- Games
    - Application Name
- Platforms
    - Platform ID
    - Platform Name
 
Global bans prevent the joining and hosting of Public and Private lobbies, but still allow Friends Only lobbies. Bans are reserved for only the most problematic users; smaller offenses can be handled by individual lobby bans.

You can view the general Fusion rules [here](RULES.md).
