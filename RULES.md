# Fusion Rules
Getting globally banned is restricted to major offenses. If any of the following rules are broken, you will receive a global ban:

### 1. Malicious Client Use
The use of "clients" (external mods) to instantly crash public servers is strictly prohibited. This can include mass constraining, rapid spawning, player despawning, etc.

The creation and distribution of these clients will also result in a global ban. You can use them in private lobbies however, as no harm is dealt.

### 2. Public Sexual Behavior
BONELAB, while a mature game, has a community consisting mostly of children. ERPing in public lobbies, consentual or forced, sexualized or normal avatars, is prohibited. If you feel the need to, please resort to Private and Friends Only lobbies.

### 3. Force Joining Private Lobbies
This extends under Rule #1, where the use of clients to join lobbies that would otherwise require a code is strictly prohibited. If you want to join a lobby, please ask the host to provide you the code.

If you find yourself worried of the possibility of users forcefully joining your lobbies, use the Friends Only or Locked visibility modes as they are secure and cannot be force joined.
