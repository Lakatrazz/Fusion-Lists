# Fusion Rules
Getting globally banned is restricted to major offenses committed across multiple lobbies. Note that these rules do NOT apply to Private lobbies, where you can do whatever you want.

#### IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
Even if the prohibited acts are committed, you may *not* receive a global ban. If you only ever do them in a single lobby or a short period of time and stop afterwards, you will not be added to the list.

Remember: global bans are for *serious offenses only*, across *multiple lobbies* for a long period of time. If you are a nuisance for maybe a few days or a week, you will be ignored. But destroying lobbies for multiple weeks in multiple servers will land you globally banned.

#### These rules are the ONLY ways to get globally banned, and they will never be extended. Other offenses can be handled by lobby hosts.

### 1. Malicious Client Use
The use of "clients" (external mods) to instantly crash Public servers is strictly prohibited.

The creation and distribution of these clients will also result in a global ban. You can use them in private lobbies however, as no harm is dealt.

Prohibited:
- Intentionally spawning hundreds of objects instantly
- Intentionally despawning players
- Intentionally mass constraining all players to a single point in the map, making the game unplayable
- Intentionally instantly crashing the server through the use of a client

Allowed:
- God Mode
- Flight
- Other minor offenses

### 2. Public Sexual Behavior
BONELAB, while a mature game, has a community consisting mostly of children. It is important to recognize that and restrict any sexual behaviour to Private or Friends Only lobbies.

Prohibited:
- ERPing in public lobbies
- ERPing with minors in general

Allowed:
- NSFW avatars (must be marked as mature on mod.io)
